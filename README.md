## CAF Enyo Client Library

This repository contains a client library for Enyo applications that interact with CAs.

If you change the library or update Enyo (currently at 2.1.1) recreate the files in the  `build` directory  using the script `tools/deploy.sh`. See https://github.com/enyojs/enyo/wiki/Bootplate for details.

In `source/util` we have added some enyo kinds to help you with authentication.

To use this client library and the authentication kinds include `app.js` and `app.css` in your app.
